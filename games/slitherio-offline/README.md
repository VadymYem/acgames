## ✨ Features & Mechanics

### 1. Authentic Snake Kinematics & Slither Wiggle
- **Rope Segment Physics**: Smooth trailing segments with fixed-distance constraints.
- **Organic Sinusoidal Slithering**: Lateral wave oscillation overlaid on movement heading.
- **Dynamic Mass Scaling**:
  - Gaining mass increases your length and segment radius logarithmically.
  - Smooth dynamic camera zoom-out as you grow, ensuring wide visibility.
- **Expressive Animated Eyes**: Dual forward-facing eyes with pupils that track your movement target and dilate during high-speed boosting.

### 2. Boost Acceleration System
- Speed increases by ~2.1x during boost.
- Drains mass gradually while dropping glowing energy pellets behind your tail.
- Requires minimum mass threshold (18 mass) to prevent over-depletion.

### 3. 12 Distinct Aesthetic Skins
- **Electric Neon** (Cyan & Deep Blue)
- **Magma Blaze** (Fire Orange & Gold)
- **Rainbow Chroma** (Real-time shifting spectral hues)
- **Cyberpunk Violet** (Hot Pink & Electric Purple)
- **Toxic Acid** (Lime Green & Emerald)
- **Golden Dragon** (Gold & Amber with dark accents)
- **Arctic Frost** (Ice Cyan & Frost White)
- **Bumblebee** (Alternating Yellow & Black Bands)
- **Midnight Phantom** (Deep Indigo & Ultraviolet)
- **Candy Swirl** (Pastel Pink & Mint)
- **Blood Ruby** (Deep Crimson & Charcoal)
- **Emerald Viper** (Jade & Neon Green)
- Live interactive S-curve animated skin preview in the start menu.

### 4. 4 AI Bot Personalities (20 - 45 Active Bots)
- **Foragers**: Wander peacefully vacuuming ambient food and steering clear of conflicts.
- **Hunters**: Compute leading intercept trajectories to boost and cut off player and other bots.
- **Scavengers**: Detect large death explosions and swarm to devour the dropped mass.
- **Coilers**: Target smaller snakes and encircle them into a deadly spiral trap.
- **Multi-Ray Sensory Feelers**: Bots cast forward sensory rays (-60° to +60°) to detect snake bodies and arena walls, swerving away from imminent collisions.
- **Continuous World Density**: Dead bots automatically respawn off-screen to keep the arena populated.

### 5. Dynamic Food Ecosystem
- **Ambient Food**: 1,800+ drifting, pulsing glowing pellets scattered across the 6,400px diameter arena.
- **Boost Drops**: Energy orbs dropped along the path of accelerating snakes.
- **Death Orbs**: Huge clusters of high-value energy released along the entire spine of a defeated snake.
- **Fleeing Prey (Fireflies)**: Fast, evasive golden fireflies that dart away when approached and leave sparkle trails. Eating them awards massive score boosts!

### 6. Procedural Web Audio API (No External Audio Files)
- **Zero Asset Loading Friction**: All sounds synthesized in real-time using oscillators, gain nodes, and biquad filters.
- Ascending pitch eating chime combos.
- Deep filtered boost jet roar.
- Impactful death burst crunch & shockwave audio.
- Enemy slain fanfare arpeggios.
- Arena boundary warning alarms.
- Integrated mute toggle and master volume slider with `localStorage` persistence.

### 7. Performance & Optimization
- **2D Spatial Hash Grid**: Rapid $O(1)$ spatial queries for collision detection and viewport culling.
- **Zero Garbage Collection Particles**: Object-pooled particle engine for smooth 60+ FPS gameplay with hundreds of simultaneous particles.
- **Device Pixel Ratio Scaling**: Ultra-crisp rendering on Retina / 4K displays.
